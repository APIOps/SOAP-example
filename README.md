# SOAP-example

This code is made for demo purposes and at the moment only works without api-key.
It uses kSOAP2 and is made for android phones.
The app requires number as user input and temperature types from dropdown menu.
Then it calls SOAP API with these informations.
SOAP API response gets changed to string and then diplayed as correct temperature.
